INCIDENT REPORT: Billing System Failure
DATE: Dec 17, 2025
REPORTED BY: Michael Scott (michael.scott@dundermifflin.com)

DESCRIPTION:
We received a critical ticket from a customer, Jan Levinson, regarding a failed transaction.
She attempted to update her billing information at 9:30 AM EST but received a 500 error.

CUSTOMER DETAILS:
Name: Jan Levinson
Email: jan.levinson@whitepages.com
Phone: 212-555-0199
Billing Address: 4500 Commerce Parkway, Cleveland, OH 44128

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:
I dug into the server logs and found that the application crashed while trying to write to the backup bucket.
It looks like a permissions issue with the legacy AWS credentials.

Here is the raw log dump from the crash:

[09:30:01] [INFO] [PaymentService] Processing payment for user 'jlevinson'.
[09:30:03] [WARN] [BackupWorker] Uploading failed transaction log to s3://dm-customer-financial-records
[09:30:03] [ERROR] [AWS_SDK] AccessDeniedException using Access Key: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
[09:30:04] [CRITICAL] [System] Connection lost to database node at 192.168.1.105
[09:30:04] [INFO] [Auth] Invalid session for user: jan.levinson@whitepages.com. Token: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

Rotate the exposed AWS key (AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE).

Contact Jan at 212-555-0199 to retry the payment.

Verify the S3 bucket policies for 'dm-customer-financial-records'.
